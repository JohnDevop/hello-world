# hello-world
I am Omole John Adetoyese, Student of Flensburg University of Applied Sciences where I am studying Wind Engineering, but my unending passion for ICT made me to run after Software development.
I am a full stack web app and native mobile app developer with years of experience with deep functional knowledge in different languages. Repeated success directing IT projects from inception to execution, strategically allocating resources and delegating tasks to achieve on-time, on-budget delivery.
